# Hi there!
Here was a little bit break in my coding life, but I'm here again with a new small and beginner project.
If you want track your skills and attributes in oblivion, please check this application.
It uses PostgreSQL database.

#### A little bit comment: Actually the using of database is don't needed (unneccecary). I used it only for practice my "Flask skill".

## Install Postgres on your computer;
## Install the following libraries:
* pip install flask
* pip install flask-sqlalchemy

### Always use a self-created database, and edit the URI:
#### SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://postgres:root@localhost/socialmedia' --> 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/database'

# Have fun!
